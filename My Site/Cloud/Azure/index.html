  <!--
    - cloud core concepts are no covered here (they are documented in AWS)
    
    - portal                  -> like aws console
    - virtual machine         -> EC2
    
    
    - azure gives us much more ability to control where we are deploying our resources (however not all regions have ability zones like in AWS)
    - each region has a region pair which is located at the same geographic area but at least 300 miles away (resiliency reasons)
    
    
    - a resource can be represented as json template
    - resource group -> logical group of a collection of resources (the idea here is to separate strategy groups like DEV STAGING PROD) (but also to grant IAM priviledges to users)
        - a service can and must belong to one resource group only
        - a resource group can be on a different location than its resources (only the meta data is stored there)
        - resource groups cannot be nested
        - resources can be moved from group to group
    - subscription    -> billing unit for an account 
    
    - Azure active directory
        - controls all priviledges
    
    
    
    -- TODO --
    - speed test        -> calculates the latency from our location to regions (not a service but a separate page found in google)
        - document it on AWS page that we can measure that
    
    - not all services are available in all regions (global services are however)
        - document it  on AWS
    
    
    - availability zones are numbered (document to AWS)
    
    
    
    
** services 
  * Compute Services
    - VM (Virtual Machine)
        -  there's a marketplace to get images (but we can get custom images as well)
    - VM scale sets
        - group of VMs scalable behind a load blancer
    - Container Registry
        - container storage 
    - Container Instances
        - container hosting solution
    - Kubernetes service
        - Azure kubernetes solution
    - App service
        - Web Application Hosting
        - supports multiple languages and containers
        - Enterprise grade web app hosting service 
    - Function App
        - simple serverless function 
        - designed for micro/nano services
    
  * Networking services (connection to cloud services, protect, monitor)
    - Vitrual Network
        - Logical network in Azoure for a group of resources
        - can contain subnetworks
        - can reside in a signle region
    - Network Security Group
        - filter outbound and inboud trafict on virtual networks
    - Virtual Network Gateways (VPN Gateway)
        - Gateway service between Azure virtual networks or a Hybrid connection
    - Azure load balancer 
        - balances the load between Azure resources
        - we can use this tool to balance the trafict between avalability zones
        - supports internal and external traffic
    - App Gateway 
        - load balancer for web (http) trafict 
    - Content Delivery Network
        - Azure CDN 
    
  * Storages
    - Storage Account (nest all below 4 types)
        - Blob Storage
            - for any unstructured data (files, etc..)
            - blob storage has containers for grouping blobs
            - has 3 tiers (quality VS price)
                - Host      -> for frequently accessing data 
                - Cool      -> for infequently accessing data 
                - Archive   -> archive (low availability but low price)
        - File Storage
            - like Blob storage but supports SMB (Server Message Block) -> file accessible remotely
            - has shares for grouping files
        - Queue Storage
            - qeue between services
        - Table Storage
            - for semi structured data soted in simple tables
            - this is not a relational database approach just storing data in tables
            - NoSQL database 
            - this service is like Dynamo Db -> fast access
    - Azure Disk Storage
        - Attachable Disk Storage form VMs 
        - Storage can be managed or unmanaged 
            - Managed
            - Unmanaged -> Each Disk is stored as file in the Blob storage
