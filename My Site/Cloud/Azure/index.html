    - cloud core concepts are no covered here (they are documented in AWS)
    
    - portal                  -> like aws console
    - virtual machine         -> EC2
    
    
    - azure gives us much more ability to control where we are deploying our resources (however not all regions have ability zones like in AWS)
    - each region has a region pair which is located at the same geographic area but at least 300 miles away 
    
    
    - a resource can be represented as json template
    - resource group -> logical group of a collection of resources (the idea here is to separate strategy groups like DEV STAGING PROD) (but also to grant IAM priviledges to users)
        - a service can and must belong to one resource group only
        - a resource group can be on a different location than its resources (only the meta data is stored there)
        - resource groups cannot be nested
        - resources can be moved from group to group
    - subscription    -> billing unit for an account 
    
    - Azure active directory
        - controls all priviledges
    
    
    -- TODO --
    - speed test        -> calculates the latency from our location to regions (not a service but a separate page found in google)
        - document it on AWS page
    
    - not all services are available in all regions (global services are however)
        - document it  on AWS
    
    
    - availability zones are numbered (document to AWS)
