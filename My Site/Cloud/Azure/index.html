  <!--
    - cloud core concepts are no covered here (they are documented in AWS)
    
    - portal                  -> like aws console
    - virtual machine         -> EC2
    
    
    - azure gives us much more ability to control where we are deploying our resources (however not all regions have ability zones like in AWS)
    - each region has a region pair which is located at the same geographic area but at least 300 miles away (resiliency reasons)
    
    
    - a resource can be represented as json template
    - resource group -> logical group of a collection of resources (the idea here is to separate strategy groups like DEV STAGING PROD) (but also to grant IAM priviledges to users)
        - a service can and must belong to one resource group only
        - a resource group can be on a different location than its resources (only the meta data is stored there)
        - resource groups cannot be nested
        - resources can be moved from group to group
    - subscription    -> just a logical container for provisionling resources  
    
    - Azure active directory
        - controls all priviledges
    
    
    
    -- TODO --
    - speed test        -> calculates the latency from our location to regions (not a service but a separate page found in google)
        - document it on AWS page that we can measure that
    
    - not all services are available in all regions (global services are however)
        - document it  on AWS
    
    
    - availability zones are numbered (document to AWS)
    
    
    
    
** services 
  * Compute Services
    - VM (Virtual Machine)
        -  there's a marketplace to get images (but we can get custom images as well)

    - Azure DDoS Protections
        - protects virtual networks from DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks
        - this is a great way to prevent savings on autoscaling solutions (multiple request would scale you auto scaling solutions)
        - has 2 tiers:
            - Basic
            - Standard <- provides monitoring and machine learning features for better protections
    
    
  * Storages
    - Storage Account (nest all below 4 types)
        - Blob Storage

            - has 3 tiers (quality VS price)
                - Host      -> for frequently accessing data 
                - Cool      -> for infequently accessing data 
                - Archive   -> archive (low availability but low price)

            - this is not a relational database approach just storing data in tables
            - NoSQL database 
            - this service is like Dynamo Db -> fast access
    - Azure Disk Storage
        - Attachable Disk Storage form VMs 
        - Storage can be managed or unmanaged 
            - Managed
            - Unmanaged -> Each Disk is stored as file in the Blob storage
    
    
  * Database Services
      - Cosmos DB
          - like table storage but this service has higth geographic availability -> therefore has lo latency 
          - supports multiple apis (SQL, MongoDb, Table Storage, Cassandra, Gremlin)

      - Azure Logic Apps
          - A series of jobs performed based on workflow (sending email, log, etc...)
          - we can specify all programming flow (linear, conditional, loop)
          - Provides a graphical interface where we can build our workflow
          - We design the flow -> Microsoft will handle the underlying services
          - we don't provide any code here, the flow activites are fully provided by Azure
      - Event Grid
          - Routes Azure messages (pub-sub model for Azure events)
          - Services can be subscribes to specific Azure events 
          - in Azure all happening is an event (ex: service creation, VM go down) we can react (subscribe) to these event to triggere services

      - Azure DevOps (provides development services)
          - Board
          - Repos
          - Pipelines (CI/CD)
          - Artifacts (host & share packages)

          - the Marketplace can provide tools here as well (for custom Azure DevOps features)
      - Azure DevTest Labs
          - Test place where developers can spin up VMs for testing purposes
          - we can start and stop these VMs for cost saving purposes

  * Azure advizor
      - give recommendation according to Azure best practices (Cost, Security, Reliability, Performance, Operational Excellence)
  * Azure Security Centery
      - continouously scans resources for security and advision stuff (Azure Advizor is buit on top to it)
      - its functionalities can be exetende by a connected Virtual Machine 
  
  
  * Azure Identity and Access management
      - Microsoft Active Directory (Entra Id)
          - manages Authorization adn Authentication not just for Azure but for all sorts of Microsoft Products (Skype, Outlook, Teams, etc...)
          - we also can use it to provide Authorization and Authentication services for our service
          - provides groups and all sorts of techniques to access restrictions

      - centalized store secrets and certificates 
      - well integrated with other Azure services
      - SDKs can provide access to these secrets
      - monitored and logged services
    
    
    - Roles
        - Roles are a collection of actions to resources 
        - There are built in roles (Owner, Contributor, etc...), but custom roles can be created
        - a role must be assigned to a scope (below level will inherit super roles)
          - hierarchy is working (role affects anything below)
              - Management Group -> Subscription -> Resource Groups -> Resources
    - Security Principal (Identity, Azure Object) (Roles can be assigned to security pricipals)
        - Users
        - Groups
        - Service Principal (Application Accounts)
    
    
    - Resource Lock
        - resources can be locked (blacklist or whitelist certain actions to perform on them)
        - lock can be created on resource or resource group or subscription level (up to subscription hierarchy level)
        - lock can be managed only by the Owner and User Access Administrator role
        
        
    - tenant represents an identity (organization, or person)
    - Entra Id (Active Directory) is one place where users, groups can be managed
    - a tenant is a single Active Directory instance 
    - a subscription can be associated witho only one Entra Id (AD) tenant (but one Entra ID instance can have multiple subscriptions)
        
        
    - TAGS
        - tag consist of key value pair attached to a sepcific resource, resource group or subscription
        - can be assigned to a resource or a resource group (tags are NOT inherited by default)
        - tags can be used for automation ect...
        
        
    - Azure Policy
        - it's basically a limitation or (permission of certain characteristing (ex: location restriciton))
        - can be assigned to an Azure scope
        - policies have nothing to do with user permissions
        - there are builtin or custom policies
        - multiple policies can be grouped -> called Initiatives
        - applying new policies will affect current of future resources only (but we can rediate to apply already resources)
        - policy effect can be applied -> what to do when the policy is violated (block, warning, etc...)
        
        
    - Blueprints
        - a reusable collection of user roles, resources and policy assignements
        
        
    - Azure Calculator 
        - to calculate service pricing
        - Ce can save mony with various tools (like reserved instance)
        - spot VM -> MS lends you the capacity for good discounts (but can take it back) -> 'spot pricing' the concept name 
        
    - Cost Management
        - with cost manatement you can track and control your spending
        
    - SLA (Service Level Agreement)
        - Microsoft promises uptime and credits you if they cannot fulfil that
        - formal agreement between Microsoft and customers
        - for free services there's no SLA!
        - composite SLA the SLA of all your services together
        - keep in mind that using multple services will lower SLA because potentially all services must be available at a time
          - SLA calculation is done by logical ways AND / OR
        
        
    ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????
    ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????
    ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????
    - explain that a scope is just a logical container hierarchy
  
  
  
    - General hierarch
      - explaine azure scope structure
