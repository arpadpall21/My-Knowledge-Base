Terraform
    - infrastructure as code
        - managing and provisioning computing infrastructure using code, often in the form of declarative configuration files, to automate the process of deployment and management.
    - open source
    - declarative approach
    - multi cloud support 
    
    - HCL (hashicorp configuration language)
    
    - terraform provider (plugins that enable terraform to interact with various cloud platforms)
    
    - terraform keeps track of the infrastructure in a state file, when we are making changes the change is compared to this state 
      - this state file is the single source of truth
    
    - creates an inmutable infrastructure (we cannot modify/upgrade existing infrastructure, but need to destroy then redeploy it again)
    
    - provisioner -> allows to run scripts or executables once the resources is created or updated
        - terraform provides 3 provisioners:
            - local-exec    -> runs commands on the machine itself runing terraform
            - remote-exec   -> runs commands on the resource via SSH
            - file          -> transfers file to the resource once created 
    
    --- commands ---
        - refresh     -> query infrastructure to get the current state
        - plan        -> create an execution plan
        - apply       -> execute the plan
        - destroy     -> destroy infrastructure
